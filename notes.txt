What is Kubernetes Deployment?
    a. Kubernetes Deployment is a resource object in Kubernetes that 
       provides a way to declaratively manage a set of identical pods.

    b. managing the deployment and scaling of a set of pod replicas.

    c. making it easier to manage, update, and scale your application 
       without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

    d. features, such as rolling updates and rollbacks, scaling, and health checks.

How do Deployments work?
    a. specifying the desired state of your application, including the 
       number of replicas and the container image to use.

    b. creates a set of identical pod replicas based on the 
       pod template specified in the Deployment.

    c. Deployment controller monitors - ensuring that the desired number of replicas 
                                        are running at all times. 
                                
    d. If you update the Deployment with a new version of the container image or other configuration changes, 
       the controller will perform a rolling update, gradually replacing the existing replicas with the 
       new ones to ensure minimal downtime.

    e. If there are any issues with the new version of the application, you can perform a rollback to the 
       previous version using the Deploymentâ€™s rollback feature.

    f. adjust the number of replicas running based on changes in traffic or other factors.

What are the Benefits of using Deployments?
    a. Automatic management of replicas.

    b. Rolling updates and rollbacks.

    c. Scaling the application up or down based on the traffic.
        i. Horizontal Scaling.
        ii. Vertical Scaling.

    d. Health checks and self-healing.

    e. Declarative configuration.

Deployment strategies
    a. Rolling Update Deployment Strategy:
        new version of the application is gradually rolled out to the cluster by updating one 
        or a few Pods at a time,while keeping the rest of the Pods running the old version.

    b. Recreate Deployment Strategy:
        With the Recreate strategy, all the existing replicas of the previous version are terminated 
        and replaced with new replicas of the new version.
    
    c. Blue/Green Deployment Strategy:
